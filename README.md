# Django Financial Dashboard Project

This project is a Django-based financial dashboard that allows users to visualize and analyze financial data. The application fetches data from Alpha Vantage, processes it using pandas, and displays interactive charts using Plotly.

---
## üìú Description

The primary goal of this project is to provide a user-friendly interface for tracking stock prices and other financial metrics. Users can select a stock symbol, and the dashboard will dynamically update to show historical price data, moving averages, and trading volumes. The backend is built with Django, handling API requests and data management, while the frontend uses Bootstrap for styling and Plotly for data visualization.
